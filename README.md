Captsha is a [ChatGPT Action](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/introduction) that allows you to remotely control Roblox servers.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/etmerda/captsha --depth 1
cd captsha
bun i
bun start
```

A .env file will be created `WRITE_KEY` defined. Copy the key for later, the GPT will use it for authentication.

Replace `https://localhost:3000` in `./captsha.openapi.json` with the URL of your web server, 

Then, in your Roblox game:

1. [Enable `HttpService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService#HttpEnabled)
2. [Enable `loadstring`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ServerScriptService#LoadStringEnabled).
3. Add [the script](./captsha.server.lua) to your game and change `SERVER_URL` to the URL of your web server.
